# Kaasi - Personal Expense Tracker üá±üá∞

## üåü Project Story

I created Kaasi primarily for fun and to automate my own expense tracking. For about three years, I was manually managing my finances using a Google Sheet. I wanted a more streamlined, private, and offline-first solution, so Kaasi was born! It's built to be a practical tool for personal use.
